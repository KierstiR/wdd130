<p>Hello! My name is Kiersti Roberts. I am a wife, a mama of two, and a software engineering major. I love to learn new things! I also enjoy reading/listening to books or other creative or educational content, playing Dungeons and Dragons with my family and friends, singing, and casual gaming. I love all things nature and outdoors activities such as hiking and camping. I love the mountains we live near and my family and I can often be found hiking there. I have an Associates degree in general studies that I earned a few years ago and I'm looking forward to furthering my education and skills. Being a mom is my favorite full time job but I also work part time as a contractor training Artificial Intelligence online. Another thing I enjoy is going to local community plays. I love watching shows with a "Shakespeare in the park" atmosphere. I've had a love for theatre and literature that began in my early school days.</p>

    <p>Utah is a beautiful state with many appealing land features including lakes, mountains, forests and rivers. It is a popular vacation spot for skiers and winter sports lovers. Home to the Utah Jazz, and BYU's football team, as well as one of the highest ranking states for Dungeons and Dragons popularity, Utah is a lovely place that many enjoy.</p>
